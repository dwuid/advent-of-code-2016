# Advent of Code
Solutions to 2016's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
Code known to be compatible with ``rustc 1.15.0-nightly``.

Just like last year, I still use these as an excuse to work with Rust. Prepare
for some non-idiomatic language features and feel free to point out more
idiomatic constructs.
